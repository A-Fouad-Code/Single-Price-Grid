# Single-Price-Grid

### Copyrights

I found this challenge on [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc).  

### Process 

I tried to go with _mobile first_ approach on this challenge by setting the ` .container ` to ` display: flex `<br> and giving it ` flex-direction: column `.  
Then I set up the media querry for larger screens.

### Summary

If you have any comments on the design specially related to responsivness please share with me.
